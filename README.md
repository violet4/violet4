### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Violet (she/her). I have 4 years of experience as a Software Engineer at data company Carjojo Corp. and am a new graduate (May 2020) from SJSU with a B.S. in CS cum laude seeking entry level positions in the cybersecurity industry. I am passionate about cybersecurity, digital privacy, and actively enhancing my awareness of analyzing, understanding, preventing and mitigating cyber threats, and am currently studying for CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional). I hold a strong interest in computer networks, relational and NoSQL databases, machine learning and AI. Ideally I am looking for positions aligned to Cybersecurity Researcher, Cybersecurity Engineer, Penetration Tester, and Security Operations Analyst.

I've tutored master and undergraduate students in machine learning, and have also mentored 3 students through SJSU PRIDE Center's PIP program. I am seeking mentorship in cybersecurity, and am also seeking to become a cybersecurity mentor.
